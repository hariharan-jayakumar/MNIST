# MNIST
# Problem Statement
Identify the number in the image and classify it between 0 to 9.

# Dataset
Training : 42000 images of dimensions 28 x 28
Test     : 28000 images of dimensions 28 x 28
Out of the 42000 training images, 10% (4200 images) were used for validation.

# Result
An accuracy of 99.485% has been achieved.

# Description
For my first contest in Kaggle, I have adopted an existing kernel submission for MNIST dataset digit prediction and toggled with the parameters of the CNN. 
This is my first experience of using Keras with Tensorflow backend. I have used knowledge from the "Deep Learning Specialization" course by Andrew Ng to design the CNN.  
The convenience of using Keras on top of Tensorflow is evident as new layers can be added in a line of code. Keras promises to be a excellent library to write deep learning code. Tensorflow 2.0 being having Keras as the high level API is a furthur boost.
Thanks to Yassine Ghouzam for the code and tutorial. Keep watching this space as I plan to make improvements on this model using this performance as a baseline.
