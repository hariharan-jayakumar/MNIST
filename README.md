# MNIST
Problem Statement
Identify the number in the image and classify it between 0 to 9.

Dataset
Training : 42000 images of dimensions 28 x 28
Test     : 28000 images of dimensions 28 x 28
Out of the 42000 training images, 10% (4200 images) were used for validation.

Result
An accuracy of 97.4% has been achieved.

Description
For my first contest in Kaggle, I have adopted an existing kernel submission for MNIST dataset digit prediction and toggled with the parameters of the CNN. 
This is my first experience of using Keras with Tensorflow backend. I have used knowledge from the "Deep Learning Specialization" course by Andrew Ng to design the CNN.  

Thanks to Yassine Ghouzam for the code and tutorial.
